You must have packages [installed on your computer](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html) to use them, which can be done using the command line and a program called \"pip\". Numpy should have been included in your python installation, but other packages might not. The easiest way to check if a package is on your computer is to try to import it and see if it can't be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bring a package into your notebook workspace, you use [the import command](https://realpython.com/python-import/). You can use the word \"from\" to specify parts of a package if you only need a function or two, and you can use the word \"as\" to give a package a nickname. It is pretty common to import numpy as np.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learn NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is known for its arrays, which are like lists but support arithmetic and a ton of other functionality. It also has many other math functions, like random number generation, trigonometry, and tons more. This places it at the core of a lot of data science work in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the drawback to NumPy is that it doesn't support labeling of rows and columns for its arrays the way that another package, Pandas, does. I encourage you to know how to use NumPy, but switch to Pandas for data storage and manipulation whenever possible in order to maintain smarter indexing. Under the hood, Pandas uses NumPy arrays - it is therefore important to know both and the distinction between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow along with this [excellent illustrated guide to NumPy](https://medium.com/better-programming/numpy-illustrated-the-visual-guide-to-numpy-3b1d4976de1d), or try the [W3schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy_intro.asp)."

    "- [pd.Index](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Index.html?highlight=index#pandas.Index): The axis labels (rows and columns of DataFrames, rows of Series) are technically stored as Index datatypes. You won't need to work with this very often since manipulating the other two classes will automatically update their associated indices.\n",

Download it from Canvas and save it in the same folder as this notebook (or modify the path below to point to your preferred location).\n",

We are interested in the 'Expression Data'; we will learn the tools for analyzing this in class. We are also interested in the 'Experimental Conditions', since the only way to interpret our results is to understand what was done to the cells to induce the gene expression we observe. Finally, the 'Gene Information' sheet describes each gene, so it will help us interpret our results, too. Let's read in all three.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see a new function the first time, I recommend finding its documentation to learn exactly what it is doing and how else it can be used. [This is the Pandas function for reading excel files used below.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html) The toolbar on the left of the pandas documentation shows related functions, so you can also learn how to read in other file types. Note that we had to specify sheet names because the file contains multiple sheets, and we use 'index_col = 0' because the labels are in the 0th column of the sheets in all cases.\n",

    "Shown above is the main dataset. We will learn how to analyze and visualize it throughout this class and the homeworks. You'll notice that:\n",

    "- The rows correspond to genes. They are labeled by locus tag, which in E. coli is also called the \"b number\". The RNA sequencing pipeline counts nearly all the coding genes and pseudogenes, resulting in 3887 rows.\n",
    "- The columns correspond to samples. Each column is a population of cells grown under a specific condition that has been RNA sequenced. These have a name that looks like xxx__yyyyy__z, where:\n",
    "    - xxx (the part before the first double underscore) is the study or project name (largest grouping)\n",
    "    - yyyyy (middle portion) is the condition name\n",
    "    - z is the replicate number\n",
    "- The elements are [log(TPM) values](https://rna-seqblog.com/rpkm-fpkm-and-tpm-clearly-explained/). They are nonnegative decimal numbers corresponding to how much the gene was expressed in the given condition. TPM refers to Transcripts Per Million total transcripts, so each column sums to approximately the same number. Gene expression tends to vary on a logarithmic scale, so the log has been taken in order to compare more linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** In this class, we have genes as rows and columns as conditions, but some data scientists prefer to use the [transpose](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.transpose.html) of this. When we move onto using some machine learning built-in functions, you will need to be prepared to transpose the dataset for using those functions. Having informative labels for the genes and conditions will help you to keep track of this."

For example, if you want to know the expression value for all genes in the base wild type glucose condition replicate 1, you access its column like this:"

    "So, each sample's Carbon Source may be one of: three concentrations of glucose (2, 4, and 5 g/L), two concentrations of acetate (2 and 3.5 g/L), or fumarate, pyruvate, or fructose. The last entry in the list, \"nan\", is short for \"not a number\", which is what Pandas uses to fill empty cells. In this case, it indicates that no carbon source was added to the base media. By the way, you can replace all nan's with another value using [fillna()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html?).\n",

    "- the pyrBI genes are less obvious, but an [EcoCyc search](https://biocyc.org/gene?orgid=ECOLI&id=EG10805) shows that they are involved in the UMP Biosynthesis pathway. You could therefore predict that fructose affects nucleotide synthesis.\n",
