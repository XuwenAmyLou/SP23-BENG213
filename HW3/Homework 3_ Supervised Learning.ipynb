    "- Both groups contain approximately equal proportions of both trace element mixture samples.\n",
    "- You always keep samples that belong to the exact same condition together. This is important, because replicates from the same condition being split into the different groups will allow the algorithm to see very similar data in both the train and test group. The purpose of a train/test split is to ensure you aren't overfitting your model, and splitting up replicates would compromise that.\n",
